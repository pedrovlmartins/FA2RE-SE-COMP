In order to see the example results, one must:
1 - open the directory with the example to be tested.
2 - open the FA2RE-SE .jar file in said directory.
3 - read the instructions and upload the DSL in the same directory.
4 - contemplate the output.

All this examples were made with the .jar tool generated with Eclipse Luna 4.4.2.
